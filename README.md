# About
AR arcade-style shooter game. User is Spaceman and crashes on Earth to escape from aliens, but must make a final stand and fight for his life.

# Goals
I want to create this game mainly because:

1. I think it would be super dope and fun

2. I want to incorporate augmented reality and markerless tracking, in which I don't need image targets to augment 3D objects. (Similar to Pokemon Go)

# Current Progress
Working on getting the UI all finished up in terms of original characters, sprites, aliens, weapon blaster, animations, etc. Lots to do :new_moon_with_face::+1:
